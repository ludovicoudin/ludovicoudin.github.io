L’objectif sera de revisiter (spatialement et temporellement) les méthodes de quantification du transport des sédiments vers les compartiments aquatiques et d’améliorer la représentation des contrôles hydrologiques et biogéochimiques dans fonctionnement de la Seine et du transport sédimentaire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninteGREEN (2025-2029)\nLe projet inteGREEN (PI S. Kotthaus) a pour objectif d’étudier la contribution de la végétalisation à la résilience des villes d’une part, et d’étudier la résilience de cette végétalisation face aux pressions climatiques et urbaines d’autre part. C’est un projet multidisciplinaire qui fait partie des programmes et équipements prioritaires de recherche (PEPR) dans le cadre des investissements stratégiques de France 2030. Il est financé par le PEPR Ville Durable et Bâtiments Innovants (VDBI), et implique deux douzaines de partenaires, intégrant équipes de recherche académique, agences et autorités régionales, compagnies privées et fédérations d’entreprises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRECRUH\nRECRUH (PI P.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Urbanization impacts ecosystem functions and services by fundamentally altering the balances between precipitation, water yield (Q), and evapotranspiration (ET) in watersheds. Accurate quantification of future hydrologic impacts is essential for national urban planning and watershed management decision making. We hypothesize that “hydrologic impacts of urbanization are not created equal” as a result of the large spatial variability in climate and land use/land cover change (LULCC). A monthly water balance model was validated and applied to quantify the hydrologic responses of 81,900 12-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) watersheds to historical and projected LULC in 2000, 2010, 2050, and 2100 in the conterminous United States (CONUS). Stepwise regression and Geographically Weighted Regression models were used to identify key factors controlling the spatially varied hydrologic impacts across CONUS. Although the simulated impact of future urbanization on mean change in water yield (ΔQ) was small at the national level, significant changes (ΔQ &gt; 50 mm/year) were found in 1,046 and 3,747 watersheds by 2050 and 2100, respectively. Hydrologic responses varied spatially and were more pronounced in the eastern United States. Overall, the impacts of urbanization on water yield were influenced by local climate, previous LULC characteristics, and the magnitude of changes in land use and impervious surfaces. The continued increase in impervious surface, especially in previously urbanized watersheds, and background precipitation contributed most to future ΔQ through both increase in direct runoff and reduction in ET. Effective national-scale integrated watershed management strategies must consider local climatic and LULC conditions to minimize negative hydrologic impacts of urbanization."

    "text": "Study region This study focused mainly on Burkina Faso in West Africa. Study focus This study aims to identify environmental variables that best explain the geographic variations of the flow intermittency regime, focusing on intermittency duration. Discharge data from 49 gauging stations were considered, mostly over large rivers. The mean number of dry months (Ndry¯) was used as a predictor to define four classes of flow intermittency, for which the potential explanatory environmental variables were assessed based on correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). New hydrological insights for the region The first two components (PCs) account for 82 % of the total variance with PC1 (52 %), and most of the catchments with similar flow intermittency are ordered according to PC2 (30 %), predominantly related to catchment permeability. Moreover, permeability was highly correlated with Ndry¯ (r = - 0.75). Results suggest that catchment permeability and catchment areas are the most critical variables in determining flow intermittency classes in Burkina Faso, as the effect of precipitation can be overruled by the ones of permeability, catchment area, and Strahler order. This study is a first step in understanding the controls of river intermittency in data-scarce and poorly gauged regions of West Africa. The identified variables could be used as input in statistical models to predict and map river intermittency and provide valuable information for stream conservation."

    "title": "Trends in floods in West Africa: analysis based on 11 catchments in the region",
    "section": "",
    "text": "After the drought of the 1970s in West Africa, the variability in rainfall and land use changes mostly affected flow, and recently flooding has been said to be an increasingly common occurrence throughout the whole of West Africa. These changes have raised many questions about the impact of climate change on the flood regimes in West African countries. This paper investigates whether floods are becoming more frequent or more severe and to what extent climate patterns have been responsible for these changes. We analyzed the trends in the floods occurring in 11 catchments within West Africa’s main climate zones. The methodology includes two methods for sampling flood events, namely the AM (annual maximum) method and the POT (peak over threshold), and two perspectives of analysis are presented: long-term analysis based on two long flood time series and a regional perspective involving 11 catchments with shorter series. The Mann–Kendall trend test and the Pettitt break test were used to detect nonstationarities in the time series. The trends detected in flood time series were compared to the rainfall index trends and vegetation indices using contingency tables in order to identify the main driver of change in flood magnitude and flood frequency. The relation between the flood index and the physiographic index was evaluated through a success criterion and the Cramer criterion calculated from the contingency tables. The results show the existence of trends in flood magnitude and flood frequency time series, with two main patterns. Sahelian floods show increasing flood trends and one Sudanian. catchment presents decreasing flood trends. For the overall catchments studied, trends in the maximum 5-day consecutive rainfall index (R5d) show good coherence with trends in flood, while the trends in normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVIs) do not show a significant agreement with flood trends, meaning that this index has possibly no impact on the behavior of floods in the region."

PE formulations often neglect the effect of carbon dioxide (CO2), which challenges their relevance in a context of climate change and rapid changes in CO2 atmospheric concentrations. In this work, we implement three options from the literature to take into account the effect of CO2 on stomatal resistance in the well-known Penman–Monteith PE formulation. We assess their impact on future runoff using the Budyko framework over France. On the basis of an ensemble of Euro-Cordex climate projections using the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, we show that taking into account CO2 in PE formulations largely reduces PE values but also limits projections of runoff decrease, especially under an emissive scenario, namely, the RCP 8.5, whereas the classic Penman–Monteith formulation yields decreasing runoff projections over most of France, taking into account CO2 yields more contrasting results. Runoff increase becomes likely in the north of France, which is an energy-limited area, with different levels of runoff response produced by the three tested formulations. The results highlight the sensitivity of hydrological projections to the processes represented in the PE formulation."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Les acteurs de l’oléiculture en Andalousie s’interrogent sur l’impact du changement climatique sur leur activité, très importante en termes de surfaces concernées, de production et de revenus. Pour tenter de leur répondre, ce travail décrit tout d’abord l’évolution du climat et des rendements annuels des oliveraies pluviales et irriguées dans la province de Jaén (Andalousie) depuis les années 50. Puis sont réalisées des modélisations des relations entre les rendements pluviaux et irrigués provinciaux et des variables climatiques TerraClimate (à résolution de 4 km), moyennées sur la zone oléicole de la province de Jaén. Enfin, les modèles permettent de calculer puis de cartographier la répartition théorique actuelle des rendements. Les rendements, très variables d’une année sur l’autre, plus élevés dans les vergers irrigués que dans les vergers pluviaux, ont fortement augmenté depuis la fin des années cinquante puis ils se sont stabilisés à partir de la fin des années 1990, avec en moyenne 30 q/ha en pluvial et 51 q/ha en irrigué pour la période 1996-2018. Par ailleurs, les températures, moyennées sur la zone oléicole de la province de Jaén, ont augmenté, surtout les températures diurnes, essentiellement durant la saison chaude. Les précipitations, très variables d’une année sur l’autre, ont diminué de 16% après 1979. Entre 1996 et 2018, les variables qui expliquent le mieux les rendements sont les pluies annuelles et les températures minimales d’automne et d’août dans les oliveraies pluviales, et les pluies et températures minimales d’automne, les températures maximales d’été et les températures minimales de février, dans les oliveraies irriguées. Des valeurs de rendement théoriques en pluvial et en irrigué sont calculées par régression multiple (1996-2018), validées par cross-validation. Les valeurs théoriques sont ensuite cartographiées sur des pixels de 4 km de côté. Si les valeurs simulées et moyennées (1996-2018) sont proches des valeurs provinciales observées, avec une erreur-moyenne de 6 q/ha en irrigué et en pluvial, leur répartition spatiale n’est pas tout à fait cohérente avec quelques informations disponibles à l’échelle communale. Il conviendra donc de perfectionner la modélisation des rendements et leur cartographie avant de passer à l’étape suivante : simuler et cartographier les rendements potentiels futurs, compte tenu du changement climatique, pour disposer d’un outil de discussion avec les oléiculteurs et les aider à préparer l’adaptation de leur activité. Olive growers in Andalusia are concerned about the impact of climate change on their activity, which is very important in terms of surface area, production and income. In an attempt to answer these questions, this work first describes the evolution of climate and annual yields of rainfed and irrigated olive groves in the province of Jaén (Andalusia) since the 1950s. Second, the relationships between rainfed and irrigated yields on one side and climatic variables on the other side are modelled. Finally, the models allow the calculation and mapping of the current theoretical spatial distribution of yields. Yields vary greatly from year to year, but are generally higher in irrigated than in rainfed orchards. Yields have risen sharply since the end of the 1950s, stabilizing since the end of the 1990s, with an average over the 1996-2018 period of 30 q/ha and 51 q/ha in irrigated and rainfed areas, respectively. Meanwhile, the mean temperatures over the olive growing area of the province of Jaén, have increased, especially for daytime and during the hot season. Rainfall, which is highly variable over the studied area, has decreased by 16% after 1979. Between 1996 and 2018, the climatic variables explaining best olive yields for rainfed areas are annual rainfall and minimum temperatures in autumn and August. Concerning irrigated areas, autumn rainfall and minimum temperatures, maximum summer temperatures and minimum February temperatures are the most relevant climatic variables. Theoretical yield values for rainfed and irrigated olive groves are calculated by multiple regression (1996-2018), validated by cross-validation. Theoretical yield values are then mapped on 4km side pixels. Although the simulated and averaged values (1996-2018) are close to the observed provincial values, with a mean error of 6 q/ha in irrigated and rainfed areas, their spatial distribution is not entirely consistent with some information available at the communal level. It will therefore be necessary to improve the modeling of yields and their mapping before moving on to the next step: simulating and mapping potential future yields, taking into account climate change, in order to have a tool for discussion with olive growers and to help them prepare the adaptation of their activity."

    "text": "Les acteurs de l’oléiculture en Andalousie s’interrogent sur l’impact du changement climatique sur leur activité, très importante en termes de surfaces concernées, de production et de revenus. Pour tenter de leur répondre, ce travail décrit tout d’abord l’évolution du climat et des rendements annuels des oliveraies pluviales et irriguées dans la province de Jaén (Andalousie) depuis les années 50. Puis sont réalisées des modélisations des relations entre les rendements pluviaux et irrigués provinciaux et des variables climatiques TerraClimate (à résolution de 4 km), moyennées sur la zone oléicole de la province de Jaén. Enfin, les modèles permettent de calculer puis de cartographier la répartition théorique actuelle des rendements. Les rendements, très variables d’une année sur l’autre, plus élevés dans les vergers irrigués que dans les vergers pluviaux, ont fortement augmenté depuis la fin des années cinquante puis ils se sont stabilisés à partir de la fin des années 1990, avec en moyenne 30 q/ha en pluvial et 51 q/ha en irrigué pour la période 1996-2018. Par ailleurs, les températures, moyennées sur la zone oléicole de la province de Jaén, ont augmenté, surtout les températures diurnes, essentiellement durant la saison chaude. Les précipitations, très variables d’une année sur l’autre, ont diminué de 16% après 1979. Entre 1996 et 2018, les variables qui expliquent le mieux les rendements sont les pluies annuelles et les températures minimales d’automne et d’août dans les oliveraies pluviales, et les pluies et températures minimales d’automne, les températures maximales d’été et les températures minimales de février, dans les oliveraies irriguées. Des valeurs de rendement théoriques en pluvial et en irrigué sont calculées par régression multiple (1996-2018), validées par cross-validation. Les valeurs théoriques sont ensuite cartographiées sur des pixels de 4 km de côté. Si les valeurs simulées et moyennées (1996-2018) sont proches des valeurs provinciales observées, avec une erreur-moyenne de 6 q/ha en irrigué et en pluvial, leur répartition spatiale n’est pas tout à fait cohérente avec quelques informations disponibles à l’échelle communale. Il conviendra donc de perfectionner la modélisation des rendements et leur cartographie avant de passer à l’étape suivante : simuler et cartographier les rendements potentiels futurs, compte tenu du changement climatique, pour disposer d’un outil de discussion avec les oléiculteurs et les aider à préparer l’adaptation de leur activité. Olive growers in Andalusia are concerned about the impact of climate change on their activity, which is very important in terms of surface area, production and income. In an attempt to answer these questions, this work first describes the evolution of climate and annual yields of rainfed and irrigated olive groves in the province of Jaén (Andalusia) since the 1950s. Second, the relationships between rainfed and irrigated yields on one side and climatic variables on the other side are modelled. Finally, the models allow the calculation and mapping of the current theoretical spatial distribution of yields. Yields vary greatly from year to year, but are generally higher in irrigated than in rainfed orchards. Yields have risen sharply since the end of the 1950s, stabilizing since the end of the 1990s, with an average over the 1996-2018 period of 30 q/ha and 51 q/ha in irrigated and rainfed areas, respectively. Meanwhile, the mean temperatures over the olive growing area of the province of Jaén, have increased, especially for daytime and during the hot season. Rainfall, which is highly variable over the studied area, has decreased by 16% after 1979. Between 1996 and 2018, the climatic variables explaining best olive yields for rainfed areas are annual rainfall and minimum temperatures in autumn and August. Concerning irrigated areas, autumn rainfall and minimum temperatures, maximum summer temperatures and minimum February temperatures are the most relevant climatic variables. Theoretical yield values for rainfed and irrigated olive groves are calculated by multiple regression (1996-2018), validated by cross-validation. Theoretical yield values are then mapped on 4km side pixels. Although the simulated and averaged values (1996-2018) are close to the observed provincial values, with a mean error of 6 q/ha in irrigated and rainfed areas, their spatial distribution is not entirely consistent with some information available at the communal level. It will therefore be necessary to improve the modeling of yields and their mapping before moving on to the next step: simulating and mapping potential future yields, taking into account climate change, in order to have a tool for discussion with olive growers and to help them prepare the adaptation of their activity."

We focus on the most widely used water balance formulas – or models – that relate long-term annual streamflow to long-term annual rainfall and long-term potential evapotranspiration estimates. Our investigation seeks to assess whether long-term streamflow can be explained by land cover attributes. As all but one of these formulas do not use land cover information, we develop a methodology to introduce land cover information into the models’ formulations. Then, the modified formulas are compared to the original ones in terms of performance and a sensitivity analysis is performed, with a special focus on the parameters representing vegetation characteristics. In line with the global coverage of long-term water balance models, we base our work on as many basins as possible (1508) representing as large a hydroclimatic variety as possible.

This paper uses a hydrological model to detect the hydrological change caused by urbanization. This study describes (1) use a statistical method to evaluate change detection relative to variation of land use change, (2) simulation of non-urban condition for the urban catchment with an alternative approach, to this aim stream flow series of urban catchments have been reconstructed from the period that urbanization had not taken place yet, and (3) the model validation with observed data.

To investigate the sensitivity of the results to the settings of both approaches, the comparison is made on a relatively large number of 43 catchments located in the United States, with relatively large gradients in terms of geomorphology and hydroclimatic characteristics. Results show that the two approaches are generally in relative good agreement in terms of detection and quantification of changes for the three flow characteristics analyzed (mean annual flow, high and low flow characteristics). Besides, it is found that the impact of urbanization on the catchment’s hydrologic response is difficult to generalize: the proportion of nonsignificant trends, significantly increasing decreasing trends are on the same order of magnitude, even if an increase in urban areas generally has a greater impact on mean flows and high flows than on low flows."

Therefore, in impact studies, the quantification of uncertainties related to PE estimation, which can arise from different sources, is crucial. Indeed, a myriad of PE formulations exist, and the uncertainties related to climate variables cascade into PE computation. To date, no consensus has emerged on the main source of uncertainty in the PE modeling chain for hydrological studies. In this study, we address this issue by setting up a multi-model and multi-scenario approach. We used seven different PE formulations and a set of 30 climate projections to calculate changes in PE. To estimate the uncertainties related to each step of the PE calculation process, namely Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios, general circulation models (GCMs), regional climate models (RCMs) and PE formulations, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) decomposition was used. Results show that mean annual PE will increase across France by the end of the century (from +40 to +130 mm y−1). In ascending order, uncertainty contributions by the end of the century are explained by PE formulations (below 10 %), RCPs (above 20 %), RCMs (30 %–40 %) and GCMs (30 %–40 %). However, under a single scenario, the contribution of the PE formulation is much higher and can reach up to 50 % of the total variance. All PE formulations show similar future trends, as climatic variables are co-dependent with respect to temperature. While no PE formulation stands out from the others, the Penman–Monteith formulation may be preferred in hydrological impact studies, as it is representative of the PE formulations’ ensemble mean and allows one to account for the coevolution of climate and environmental drivers."

We compare two different visions of similarity: the apparent similarity defined on the basis of observable catchment properties, and behavioral similarity judged through the use of hydrological models. These two visions are generally assumed to be merged in regionalization studies: Catchments having apparently similar physical characteristics are assumed to have a similar hydrological behavior. In this paper, we wished to test the validity of this assumption. To this aim, we defined behavioral (hydrological) similarity on the basis of model parameter transferability. Then pools of hydrologically similar catchments are compared with pools of apparently physically similar catchments, as identified on the basis of physiographic catchment descriptors. The overlap between the two pools of similar catchments is analyzed, making it possible to judge the efficiency of the physical similarity measure and to identify hydrologically similar catchments in an ungauged context. The results show that the overlap between the two pools is significant for only 60% of the catchments. For the other catchments, two major reasons were identified as contributing to the lack of overlap: (1) these catchments often have a quite specific hydrological behavior and (2) the role of the underground properties of the catchment on its hydrological behavior was not found to be accurately described by the available physical descriptors, meaning that more relevant catchment descriptors should be sought to better describe the geological and lithological context in hydrological terms."

    "text": "Hydrological models should be tested and evaluated for a wide variety of levels of urbanization before they are used to predict the impact of urbanization on catchment behavior. In this study, we illustrate a top–down approach of modifying step by step an hourly conceptual model structure (GR4H) to account for urbanization features. Modifying the original model structure included accounting explicitly for runoff from impervious surfaces by bypassing the soil moisture reservoir and varying the partitioning between quick flow and slow flow. These adaptations were chosen based on the reported specificities of urbanized catchments, namely, decreasing infiltration, increasing runoff, and fast runoff dynamics. Using a split-sample test, the relevance of each modification with regard to the reproduction of catchment response (i.e., observed streamflow) was assessed for a large sample of 273 urbanized catchments, located in France and the United States, for which mean total impervious area (TIA) varied between 0.05 and 0.59. Six continuous and three event-based criteria were used, and two statistical tests were applied to assess the significance of improvements. Results showed the following: (i) Tested modifications improved the ability of the model to reproduce the catchment response, especially high flows and observed streamflow amid dry conditions. (ii) Event-based evaluation using more than 45,000 events showed an improvement in predicting the event peak flow and event runoff volume, whereas no significant improvements were obtained in predicting the timing of peak flow. (iii) Newly added parameters were moderately to highly correlated with TIA, especially the calibrated proportion of impervious surfaces, which is promising as a hydrological validation of estimated urbanization measures from land cover. The tested modifications improved both the representation of urbanization processes and the reproduction of the observed streamflow, yielding a simple and credible model for predicting the impact of future urbanization scenarios on catchment response."

    "section": "",
    "text": "An implementation of the complementary relationship hypothesis (Bouchet’s hypothesis) for estimating regional evapotranspiration within two rainfall-runoff models is proposed and evaluated in terms of streamflow simulation efficiency over a large sample of 308 catchments located in Australia, France and the USA. Complementary relationship models are attractive approaches to estimating actual evapotranspiration because they rely solely on climatic variables. They are even more interesting since they are supported by a conceptual description underlying the interactions between the evapotranspirating surface and the atmospheric boundary layer, which was highlighted by Bouchet (1963). However, these approaches appear to be in contradiction with the methods prevailing in rainfall-runoff models, which compute actual evapotranspiration using soil moisture accounting procedures. The approach adopted in this article is to introduce the estimation of actual evapotranspiration provided by complementary relationship models (complementary relationship for areal evapotranspiration and advection aridity) into two rainfall-runoff models. Results show that directly using the complementary relationship approach to estimate actual evapotranspiration does not give better results than the soil moisture accounting procedures. Finally, we discuss feedback mechanisms between potential evapotranspiration and soil water availability, and their possible impact on rainfall-runoff modelling.

    "text": "Evapotranspiration is a major component of the catchment water balance and potential evapotranspiration (PE) data should therefore be a key input to rainfall-runoff models. Nevertheless, it is common to use mean PE (i.e. the same seasonally variable PE, identically repeated each year) instead of temporally varying PE as input to rainfall-runoff models, due to the scarcity of meteorological data. This article investigates the validity of using mean PE instead of temporally varying PE as input to four different daily rainfall-runoff models. The investigation focuses on Penman PE estimates. The value of PE inputs for rainfall-runoff modelling is assessed in terms of streamflow simulation efficiency over a large sample of 308 catchments located in France, Australia and the United States. We found no systematic improvements in the rainfall-runoff model efficiencies when using temporally varying PE instead of mean PE, and we conclude that the insensitivity of rainfall-runoff models to detailed PE knowledge may bring into question the very concept of PE."

Dans un premier temps, nous analysons la structure de départ et la sensibilité des paramètres qu’elle contient à la présence de surfaces urbaines dans le bassin versant. Pour ce faire, un échantillon de 365 bassins versants français et américains a été construit. Le modèle est calé sur deux périodes pour chaque bassin versant, donnant ainsi 730 couples bassin-période pour lesquels la fraction urbaine dans le bassin a été déterminée. L’analyse de la sensibilité des paramètres du modèle hydrologique par rapport à cette fraction ainsi que d’autres indicateurs hydrologiques a été effectuée pour une sélection de 416 couples bassin-période, homogènes en surface. Les résultats montrent que les paramètres du modèle et les indicateurs hydrologiques présentent des différences significatives entre un échantillon de bassins versants fortement urbanisés et un échantillon de bassins versants faiblement urbanisés, traduisant des écoulements plus rapides et plus importants sur les bassins fortement urbanisés. Several models can be used in order to represent the hydrological processes in an urbanized catchment. Developing those models has been with respect to modeling objectives, spatiotemporal scale and hydroclimatic and spatial data availability. These models can be explicit, hence complex and data demanding, or rather implicit, but lacking direct linking between the model parameters and the urbanization features. Leaning toward simplicity, we aim at developing an efficient modeling tool that permits implicitly to take into account the spatial configuration (urban landscape vs. natural surfaces) and temporal evolution at the scale of an urbanized hydrological catchment. Development of such tool can be achieved by complexifying step-by-step a starting model structure that is not dedicated to urbanized contexts. Before conducting structure modifications, the first step to take is to determine which model functions can be modified. In this paper, we analyze the initial structure and the sensitivity of the parameters that it contains to the presence of urban surfaces within the catchment. For this end, a large sample of 365 French and American catchments was prepared. These catchments are of various sizes going from 1 to 5000 km2 and represent a large panel of hydroclimatic conditions. The model was calibrated on two periods for each catchment, leading to 730 catchment-period couples for which the fraction of the urban cover was determined. The sensitivity analysis of the model parameters and other hydrological indicators with respect to this fraction was conducted for a selection of area-homogeneous 416 catchment-period couples. The results of this empirical study have shown (1) good model performances at the hourly time step regardless of the urban condition of the catchment and (2) that the model parameters and the hydrological indicators are significantly different with regards to intensively or slightly urbanized catchments, reflecting faster and greater streamflows for intensively urbanized situations."

Results show a clear modulation of land use on evapotranspiration, suggesting larger and lower evaporation rates over croplands and urban areas respectively. The proposed formulation was able to reasonably predict the magnitude of the decrease of the evaporative ratio on urbanizing catchments, but fails to efficiently predict the hydrological impacts of vegetated land use conversions, both in terms of direction and magnitude of changes.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX) is an international project aimed at developing enhanced techniques for the a priori estimation of parameters in hydrologic models and in land surface parameterization schemes of atmospheric models. The MOPEX science strategy involves three major steps: data preparation, a priori parameter estimation methodology development, and demonstration of parameter transferability. A comprehensive MOPEX database has been developed that contains historical hydrometeorological data and land surface characteristics data for many hydrologic basins in the United States (US) and in other countries. This database is being continuously expanded to include more basins in all parts of the world. A number of international MOPEX workshops have been convened to bring together interested hydrologists and land surface modelers from all over world to exchange knowledge and experience in developing a priori parameter estimation techniques. This paper describes the results from the second and third MOPEX workshops. The specific objective of these workshops is to examine the state of a priori parameter estimation techniques and how they can be potentially improved with observations from well-monitored hydrologic basins. Participants of the second and third MOPEX workshops were provided with data from 12 basins in the southeastern US and were asked to carry out a series of numerical experiments using a priori parameters as well as calibrated parameters developed for their respective hydrologic models. Different modeling groups carried out all the required experiments independently using eight different models, and the results from these models have been assembled for analysis in this paper. This paper presents an overview of the MOPEX experiment and its design. The main experimental results are analyzed. A key finding is that existing a priori parameter estimation procedures are problematic and need improvement. Significant improvement of these procedures may be achieved through model calibration of well-monitored hydrologic basins. This paper concludes with a discussion of the lessons learned, and points out further work and future strategy."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX) is an international project aimed at developing enhanced techniques for the a priori estimation of parameters in hydrologic models and in land surface parameterization schemes of atmospheric models. The MOPEX science strategy involves three major steps: data preparation, a priori parameter estimation methodology development, and demonstration of parameter transferability. A comprehensive MOPEX database has been developed that contains historical hydrometeorological data and land surface characteristics data for many hydrologic basins in the United States (US) and in other countries. This database is being continuously expanded to include more basins in all parts of the world. A number of international MOPEX workshops have been convened to bring together interested hydrologists and land surface modelers from all over world to exchange knowledge and experience in developing a priori parameter estimation techniques. This paper describes the results from the second and third MOPEX workshops. The specific objective of these workshops is to examine the state of a priori parameter estimation techniques and how they can be potentially improved with observations from well-monitored hydrologic basins.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Given the contradictory results from recent studies, this paper compares classical regionalization schemes of catchment model parameters over the wide range of hydroclimates found in France. To ensure the generality of the conclusions, we used two lumped rainfall-runoff models applied to daily data over a large set of 913 French catchments. Three types of approaches were considered: regionalization using regression, regionalization based on spatial proximity and regionalization based on physical similarity. This comparison shows that in France, where a dense network of gauging stations is available, spatial proximity provides the best regionalization solution. The regression approach is the least satisfactory, with results very close to those obtained using one median parameter set for the whole country. The physical similarity approach is intermediary. However, the results obtained with these three methods lag far behind those obtained by full model calibration. Our results also show that some improvement could be made by combining spatial proximity and physical similarity, and that there is still considerable room for progress in the field of ungaged catchment modeling."

Although these datasets are now commonly used for hydrological modeling, the representation of precipitation amount and timing is crucial to correctly model streamflow. The Génie Rural à 4 paramètres journalier (GR4J) conceptual hydrological model combined with the CEMANEIGE snow routine was calibrated using four temperature and precipitation datasets [Système d’analyse fournissant des renseignements atmosphériques à la neige (SAFRAN), Mesoscale Analysis (MESAN), E-OBS, and Water and Global Change (WATCH) Forcing Data ERA-Interim (WFDEI)] on 931 French gauged catchments ranging in size from 10 to 10 000 km2. The efficiency of the calibrated hydrological model in simulating streamflow was higher for the models calibrated on high-resolution meteorological datasets (SAFRAN, MESAN) compared to coarse-resolution datasets (E-OBS, WFDEI), as well as for reanalysis (SAFRAN, MESAN, WFDEI) compared to datasets based on interpolation only (E-OBS). The systematic decrease in efficiency associated with precipitation bias or temporality highlights that the use of a hydrological model calibrated on meteorological datasets can assess these datasets, most particularly precipitation. It appears essential that datasets account for high-resolution topography to accurately represent elevation gradients and assimilate dense ground-based observation networks. This is particularly emphasized for hydrological applications in mountainous areas and areas subject to finescale events. For hydrological applications on nonmountainous regions, not subject to finescale events, both regional and global datasets give satisfactory results. It is crucial to continue improving precipitation datasets, especially in mountainous areas, and to assess their sensitivity to eventual corrupted observations.

This study uses large-sample hydrology to identify major catchment controls on daily runoff simulations. It is based on a conceptual lumped hydrological model (GR6J), a collection of 29 catchment characteristics, a multinational set of 1103 catchments located in Austria, France, and Germany and four runoff model efficiency criteria. Two analyses are conducted to assess how features and criteria are linked: (i) a one-dimensional analysis based on the Kruskal-Wallis test and (ii) a multidimensional analysis based on regression trees and investigating the interplay between features. The catchment features most affecting model performance are the flashiness of precipitation and streamflow (computed as the ratio of absolute day-to-day fluctuations by the total amount in a year), the seasonality of evaporation, the catchment area, and the catchment aridity. Nonflashy, nonseasonal, large, and nonarid catchments show the best performance for all the tested criteria. We argue that this higher performance is due to fewer nonlinear responses (higher correlation between precipitation and streamflow) and lower input and output variability for such catchments. Finally, we show that, compared to national sets, multinational sets increase results transferability because they explore a wider range of hydroclimatic conditions."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Studies quantifying the impact of climate change have so far mostly examined atmospheric variables, and few are evaluating the cascade of aquatic impacts that will occur along the land–ocean continuum until the ultimate impacts on coastal eutrophication potential. In this study, a new hydro-biogeochemical modeling chain has been developed, based on the coupling of the generic pyNuts-Riverstrahler biogeochemical model and the GR4J-CEMANEIGE hydrological model, and applied to the Seine River basin (France). Averaged responses of biogeochemical variables to climate-induced hydrological changes were assessed using climate forcing based on 12 projections of precipitation and temperature (BC-CORDEX) for the stabilization (RCP 4.5) and the increasing (RCP 8.5) CO2 emission scenarios. Beyond the amount of nutrients delivered to the sea, we calculated the indicator of coastal eutrophication potential (ICEP). The models run with the RCP4.5 stabilization scenario show low variations in hydrological regimes and water quality, while five of the six models run with the increasing CO2 emissions scenario (RCP8.5) leads to more intense extreme streamflow (i.e., higher maximum flows, lower and longer minimum flows), resulting in the degradation of water quality. For the driest RCP 8.5 projection, median biogeochemical impacts induced by decreasing discharge (until −270 m3 s−1 in average) are mostly located downstream of major wastewater treatment plants. During spring bloom, e.g., in May, the associated higher residence time leads to an increase of phytoplankton biomass (+31% in average), with a simultaneous −23% decrease of silicic acid, followed downstream by a −9% decrease of oxygen. Later during low flow, major increases in nitrate and phosphate concentrations (until +19% and +32% in average) are expected. For all considered scenarios, high ICEP values (above zero) lasted, indicating that coastal eutrophication is not expected to decrease with changing hydrological conditions in the future. Maximum values are even expected to be higher some years. This study deliberately evaluates the impact of modified hydrology on biogeochemistry without considering the simultaneous alteration of water temperatures, in order to disentangle the causes of climate change-induced impact. It will serve as a first comparative step toward a more complete modeling experiment of climate change impacts on aquatic systems."

For all considered scenarios, high ICEP values (above zero) lasted, indicating that coastal eutrophication is not expected to decrease with changing hydrological conditions in the future. Maximum values are even expected to be higher some years. This study deliberately evaluates the impact of modified hydrology on biogeochemistry without considering the simultaneous alteration of water temperatures, in order to disentangle the causes of climate change-induced impact. It will serve as a first comparative step toward a more complete modeling experiment of climate change impacts on aquatic systems."

To this aim, a methodology is presented providing detailed tracking of the treatment of PE input by two rainfall-runoff models. Since uncertainties affect both the structures and the inputs of rainfall-runoff models, the analysis is based on synthetic flow data. Standard synthetic streamflow series were generated using a standard PE input. Then, the PE series were corrupted successively by random and autocorrelated errors, and the propagation of these errors through the models’ state variables is followed. For comparison, the same methodology was applied to rainfall data. The analysis is focused on two lumped rainfall-runoff models (the GR4J model and a lumped version of TOPMODEL) over a large sample of 308 watersheds. The investigation shows that perturbation errors in the potential evapotranspiration are absorbed by the model’s production (soil moisture accounting) reservoir, which controls the water losses from the model. Given the slow variations in the soil moisture accounting reservoir, rainfall-runoff models behave like low-pass filters, absorbing high-frequency variations of PE inputs. In contrast, the models tested here do not smooth the rainfall perturbation."

Results showed: (a) Except for the ratio of streamflow flashiness to precipitation flashiness, the range of hydrological signature metrics in rural catchments encompassed the specificities of urbanized ones. Overall, the urbanized catchments showed higher ratios of mean streamflow to mean precipitation (median values: 0.39 vs. 0.27) and streamflow flashiness to precipitation flashiness (0.13 vs. 0.03), besides lower baseflow index (0.42 vs. 0.62) and shorter characteristic response time (3 vs. 14 hr). (b) The performances of GR4H revealed no significant distinction between rural and urbanized catchments in terms of Kling–Gupta Efficiency (KGE), whereas IHACRES better simulated urbanized catchments, especially during summer.

    "text": "River cross-sections data are required to represent channel geometry in hydrodynamic models. In the absence of accurate data at regional scale, simplified or parameterized cross sections are often used, which might affect the performance of the hydrodynamic model. In this study we assess the sensitivity of a 1D Saint–Venant hydraulic model to different types of river morphological data. The question is addressed using a 1D unsteady hydraulic model (HEC-RAS), with lateral inflows provided by the hydro(geo)logical model Eau-Dyssée, to explore a wide spectrum of river geometry scenarios, regarding river bed slopes and cross-sectional shapes. The target scale is the one of the Seine River (France). As a gateway for larger and more complex regional hydro(geo)logical applications, our case-study covers a well-described 89-km reach in a sub-tributary of the Seine River. River morphology is described by high-resolution cross-sections, and Manning’s roughness coefficient (n) is used for calibration against observed discharges and river stages in a mid-reach control point, with satisfactory performances over the 8-year simulation period. The resulting model still simulates realistic discharge hydrographs when forced with degraded channel geometry data, using either fewer cross-sections or approximated ones. In such cases, however, the hydraulic model does not always satisfactorily predict the associated water levels when compared to observations. In certain geometry scenarios, the RMSE between simulated water levels using degraded geometry and observations may go up to 0.3m. The study confirms that the accuracy of predicted water levels and maximum water depths simulated by a Saint–Venant model relies on an accurate representation of channel geometry and bed level slopes along the river reach. From the various scenarios, it appears that the longitudinal description of the bed level profiles has a larger impact on the simulation of water levels than the cross-sectional shapes. This offers interesting implications for flood forecast mapping applications and regional scale models that often use simplified river geometry and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) built by remote sensing technologies to simulate the water levels."

Improving the accuracy of rainfall-runoff models and in particular their performances in flood prediction is a key point of continental hydrology. Methods have been developed to improve flood prediction in hydrology based on a better compliance of the model with current observations prior to its use in forecasting mode. This operation has been termed updating in hydrology and assimilation in meteorology. The fundamental idea is that if model predictions diverge from observations at a given time, there is little chance that future estimations will approach correct values. The improvement then comes from a correction of the trajectory of the model based on observations during the period preceding the day when a prediction into the immediate or long-term future is desired. This can be dealt with by a correction of model parameters, which is usually called “parameter updating”. The inability of rainfall-runoff models to produce correct streamflow values generally translates into parameter uncertainty. Parameter calibration is the means used by a model structure to adjust to a given set of data. Therefore, a parameter updating methodology seems to be a natural way to amend errors in streamflow values. In this paper, a specific methodology of parameter updating is presented. The main feature of this method is that it does not carry out updating by reference only to recent streamflow observations, as classic procedures do, but also to soil moisture measurements, which can be retrieved daily from TDR probes. Indeed, it appears that the integration of soil moisture data allows better control of the evolution of the model and improves its performances, in particular in terms of forecasting. The aim of the research was to assess the usefulness of this additional soil moisture information. To this end, an approach has been suggested that gradually introduces additional information thanks to a constraint relationship between observed and modelled soil moisture. In fact, soil moisture can be calculated implicitly or explicitly by the model when extracting step-by-step the values of the model’s store contents. This methodology was put forward for use in the European AIMWATER project on four catchments within the Seine River basin upstream of Paris (France). The other issue addressed in this paper was whether or not it is necessary to use a model that simulates explicitly the evolution of soil moisture at different depths. One can argue that if the model employed does not feature a store that can be identified closely to the observed soil moisture, there would be no possibility of benefiting from such measurements. On the other hand, it can be argued that if soil moisture is a model output, all the information drawn from soil moisture observations will be directed at improving this specific output at the expense of improving streamflow values. To answer this issue, two models were tested. The first model, GR4j, has no explicit counterpart for soil moisture measurements. The second one, GRHum, has been especially developed to introduce a two-layer soil reservoir that simulates the surface and sub-surface soil moisture. Since the aim of the present research was to analyse different ways of accounting for soil moisture, and to identify the one that offers the best prospects, several tests were carried out, using different relationships between observed and modelled soil moisture. Indeed, TDR probes give point measurements of soil moisture at several depths and several store contents can be taken into account in a constraint relationship. First, for both GR4j and GRHum models, tests showed that performances for flood forecasting are significantly improved when assimilating in situ measurements of soil moisture at a daily time-step, especially for the basins where poor simulations are obtained. It is also noteworthy that performances are very dependent on the items taken into account in a constraint relationship. Secondly, the GRHum model did not appear to be more efficient than the GR4j model when assimilating both streamflow and soil moisture data. However, the GRHum model gave the best results when assimilating only streamflow data, and superficial soil moisture seemed to fit the GRHum better than the GR4j model. Finally, although the tests required perfect foreknowledge of rainfall, the results of the research are encouraging from an operational point of view. Another interesting perspective is provided by the Earth Observation data. Indeed, previous studies have shown that soil moisture can be derived from EO data using, for example, microwave spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images (QUESNEY et al., 2000). This type of catchment-scale data could be more relevant than a local measure given by TDR probes (PAUWELS et al., 2002)."

Indeed, although classical rainfall–discharge models are often calibrated based on their efficiency in simulating discharge time series, this does not warrant an optimal representation of certain of the system’s hydrodynamic properties, since these properties are used for water management purposes. Therefore, this paper investigates the trade-off between two objectives: (i) good discharge simulations in terms of the least mean square errors and (ii) the ability to reproduce the autocorrelation function of the discharge time series. For this purpose, we applied two rainfall–discharge models on the Baget karst system, an extensively studied system located in the French Pyrenees. The results show that a single-objective calibration based on the classical Nash and Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) coefficient gives relatively satisfying modelling results, but the autocorrelation function is systematically overestimated. The proposed multi-objective approach improves the ability of the model to mimic the autocorrelation function without greatly altering the model’s NSE efficiency.

The study focuses on the Oise basin (a 17,000km2 sub-basin of the Seine River basin, in Northern France). An upscaling method is proposed to benefit from high resolution hydraulic modeling at local scale to improve the simulation of river stages at regional scale. The methodology is based on simulation of the main rivers with a 1D Saint–Venant approach, from which functional stage-discharge relationships, are derived and projected onto each grid-cell of the regional model. At regional scale, the rating curves are used as boundary conditions and allow to calculate river stage, which is then used to calculate the exchanges between aquifer units and river. The approach is efficient to better simulate water pathways and stream-aquifer interactions at regional scale with low computing cost. The model was used to quantify stream to aquifer exchanges, that are in average 39mmyr−1 for aquifer to stream fluxes and 2mmyr−1 for stream to aquifer fluxes, mainly due to storage in aquifer units during storm events."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Due to polar amplification of climate change, high latitudes are warming up twice as fast as the rest of the world. This warming leads to permafrost thawing, which increases the thickness of the overlying active layer and modifies the subsurface hydrologic regime of the draining watershed, therefore affecting baseflow to surface water and modifying recession characteristics. The active layer thickening and the subsurface flow modification are assumed to be linearly correlated. The objective of this study is to test this assumption by quantifying the correlation between the temporal evolution of hydrologic parameters (recession slope and initial recession outflow) and 11 controlling factors (all linked to surface, subsurface and climatic conditions) for 336 Arctic catchments from 1970 to 2000. Contrary to previous studies, we demonstrate a clear decrease in recession slope and initial recession outflow over 1970–2000 for a majority of catchments at any significance level. We explain this result by identifying high topography and low permafrost extent as controlling factors that complexify the relationship between trends in recession parameters and active layer thickness evolution. The study goes further by identifying the mechanisms behind the complexification of the relationship: permafrost-extent loss, hydrologic-connectivity increase, flow-path-diversity increase, contributing drainage area multiplication. The novel aspect of the study lay behind the large number of studied catchments and the large range of controlling factors tested."

The active layer thickening and the subsurface flow modification are assumed to be linearly correlated. The objective of this study is to test this assumption by quantifying the correlation between the temporal evolution of hydrologic parameters (recession slope and initial recession outflow) and 11 controlling factors (all linked to surface, subsurface and climatic conditions) for 336 Arctic catchments from 1970 to 2000. Contrary to previous studies, we demonstrate a clear decrease in recession slope and initial recession outflow over 1970–2000 for a majority of catchments at any significance level. We explain this result by identifying high topography and low permafrost extent as controlling factors that complexify the relationship between trends in recession parameters and active layer thickness evolution. The study goes further by identifying the mechanisms behind the complexification of the relationship: permafrost-extent loss, hydrologic-connectivity increase, flow-path-diversity increase, contributing drainage area multiplication. The novel aspect of the study lay behind the large number of studied catchments and the large range of controlling factors tested."

    "text": "This research sought to identify the most relevant approach to calculate potential evapotranspiration (PE) for use in a daily rainfall–runoff model, while answering the following question: How can we use available atmospheric variables to represent the evaporative demand at the basin scale? The value of 27 PE models was assessed in terms of streamflow simulation efficiency over a large sample of 308 catchments located in France, Australia and the United States. While trying to identify which atmospheric variables were the most relevant to compute PE as input to rainfall–runoff models, we showed that the formulae based on temperature and radiation tend to provide the best streamflow simulations. Surprisingly, PE approaches based on the Penman approach seem less advantageous to feed rainfall–runoff models. This investigation has resulted in a proposal for a temperature-based PE model, combining simplicity and efficiency, and adapted to four rainfall–runoff models. This PE model only requires mean air temperature (derived from long-term averages) and leads to a slight but steady improvement in rainfall–runoff model efficiency."

Two sources of uncertainty were considered: (i) the dependence of the optimal parameter set on the climate characteristics of the calibration period and (ii) the use of several posterior parameter sets over a given calibration period. The first source of uncertainty often refers to the lack of model robustness, while the second one refers to parameter uncertainty estimation based on Bayesian inference. Two rainfall-runoff models were tested on 89 catchments in northern and central France. The two sources of uncertainty were assessed in the past observed period and in future climate conditions. The results show that, given the evaluation approach followed here, the lack of robustness was the major source of variability in streamflow projections in future climate conditions for the two models tested. The hydrological projections generated by an ensemble of posterior parameter sets are close to those associated with the optimal set. Therefore, it seems that greater effort should be invested in improving the robustness of models for climate change impact studies, especially by developing more suitable model structures and proposing calibration procedures that increase their robustness."

In these catchments, hydrologists may still need to simulate continuous streamflow time series using a rainfall-runoff model, and the methodology presented here allows using few point measurements for model parameterization. The method combines regional information (parameter sets of neighboring gauged stations) and local information (contributed by the point measurements) within a framework where the relative weight of each source of information is made dependent on the number of point measurements available. This approach is tested with two different hydrological models on a set of 609 catchments in France. The results show that on average a few flow measurements can significantly improve the simulation efficiency, and that 10 measurements can reduce the performance gap between the gauged and ungauged situations by more than 50%. The added value of regional information progressively decreases until being almost insignificant when sufficient flow measurements are available. Model parameters tend to come closer to the values obtained by calibration in fully gauged conditions as the number of point flow measurements increases."

    "text": "Climate change has emerged as a major concern at both regional and global scales in recent decades. Northwestern Algeria is particularly vulnerable as a semi-arid zone, where changes in climate and land cover (LC) will have a significant impact on vegetation in the long term. This study analyses, through a multidimensional approach, the influence of climate change and LC on vegetation dynamics. Hierarchical partitioning (HP) analysis was conducted to determine the most influential climatic variables (precipitation, temperature) on the dynamics of NDVI. The results show that the annual NDVI shows a fluctuating spatial trend between decrease and increase in different regions. Trends in seasonal NDVI are spatially varied and less uniform. Variations in precipitation are stable, while temperatures show clear and consistent significant increases across the region, with a general tendency to increase (p&lt;0.01) in spring and summer. In mountainous areas, NDVI shows an increasing trend both annually and seasonally. The correlation (r²) between NDVI, temperature and precipitation (0.75–1.0) over the different seasons reveals significant seasonal and regional variability. LC transition patterns also influence spatio-temporal trends in vegetation cover. They reveal that the rate of change of NDVI varies between LC types and regions, with resilience in forests and grasslands. These variations have significant implications for vegetation dynamics, as observed by NDVI."

Two different rainfall-runoff model structures were tested to get a more general overview on this issue. A dynamic sensitivity analysis approach was adopted (i.e. with re-calibration of model parameters). Results indicate that watershed models use their different functions (and corresponding parameters) to absorb input errors and muffle their impact on streamflow simulations. The main conclusions are: (1) models are almost insensitive to random errors in PE series, which comes from the inherent low pass filter properties of rainfall-runoff models; (2) random errors in rainfall series significantly affect model performances and parameter values; (3) systematic errors in PE series have a greater impact than random errors, but they are partly buffered by Soil Moisture Accounting (SMA) stores; (4) systematic errors in rainfall time series, when large enough, can be very detrimental to model performances but their impact can be reduced if the model structure includes a procedure other than evapotranspiration to adapt water balance."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This study presents an analysis of climate-change impacts on the water resources of two basins located in northern France, by integrating four sources of uncertainty: climate modelling, hydrological modelling, downscaling methods, and emission scenarios. The analysis focused on the evolution of the water budget, the river discharges and piezometric heads. Seven hydrological models were used, from lumped rainfall-discharge to distributed hydrogeological models, and led to quite different estimates of the water-balance components. One of the hydrological models, CLSM, was found to be unable to simulate the increased water stress and was, thus, considered as an outlier even though it gave fair results for the present day compared to observations. Although there were large differences in the results between the models, there was a marked tendency towards a decrease of the water resource in the rivers and aquifers (on average in 2050 about −14 % and −2.5 m, respectively), associated with global warming and a reduction in annual precipitation (on average in 2050 +2.1 K and −3 %, respectively). The uncertainty associated to climate models was shown to clearly dominate, while the three others were about the same order of magnitude and 3–4 times lower. In terms of impact, the results found in this work are rather different from those obtained in a previous study, even though two of the hydrological models and one of the climate models were used in both studies. This emphasizes the need for a survey of the climatic-change impact on the water resource."

    "text": "Explaining the response of catchments with a mix of pervious and impervious surfaces requires the inclusion of controls other than catchment imperviousness. In this study, we made use of a large sample of 70,227 events in 852 U.S. catchments to analyze the interplay of total impervious area (TIA) and antecedent soil moisture (ASM) in determining the event runoff ratio (RR). First, we investigated the importance of TIA as a spatial control compared to other catchment attributes (describing climate and catchment landscape) in explaining the differences between catchments in terms of median event-scale RR. Second, we examined the importance of ASM as a temporal control of the variability of RR in comparison with spatial settings and event characteristics. Third, events were grouped into 30 classes of TIA and 30 classes of ASM, and linear regression models were used to analyze the evolution of RR depending on each one of the two independent variables. Results showed the following: (1) Analysis of the importance of space-varying catchment descriptors highlighted the relevance of TIA as a control of catchment response, whereas ASM showed a stronger ability compared to other event characteristics. (2) ASM played a significant role in urbanized catchments as in rural ones. The absence of abrupt changes in the linear model parameters indicates that the impact of urbanization on the relationship between RR and ASM was relatively gradual. (3) Differences in RR between rural and intensively urbanized catchments were observable not only for dry pre-event conditions but also for wet short-term conditions."

We assessed the reliability of 21 satellite-based and reanalysis precipitation products (P-datasets) through a direct comparison with 24 rain gauge station measurements at the monthly time step, using four statistical indicators: Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE), Correlation Coefficient (CC), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Bias.

New hydrological insights for the region based on the KGE and the CC scores, WFDEI (WATCH Forcing Data methodology applied to ERA-Interim), CMORPH-BLD (Climate Prediction Center MORPHing satellite-gauge merged) and MSWEP (Multi-Source Weighted Ensemble Precipitation) are the most accurate for estimating rainfall at the national scale. Additionally, the results reveal a high discrepancy between bio-climatic regions. The merged dataset reveals higher performance than the other products in all situations.

Ensuring a sustainable approach to urban water management requires a deeper understanding of the urban hydroclimate. This thesis addresses this need by investigating urban effects on precipitation, influences on natural surface properties, and the interactions between atmospheric and hydrological systems in shaping the urban hydroclimate. A multidisciplinary approach is adopted, integrating insights from both atmospheric and hydrological sciences and combining empirical analyses of observed data with modeling to provide complementary perspectives. The study begins by examining urban effects on precipitation through a combination of literature review and machine learning to assess any consensus. Given the lack of agreement among studies using radar precipitation data, a consistent wind-based radar methodology is applied to a broad sample of cities over the USA and Europe. This approach aims to determine if urban areas have a consistent influence on precipitation patterns across regions, addressing the challenge of generalizing urban effects on precipitation. The modeling aspect includes a review of existing urban land surface models, focusing on their representation of surface hydrological processes and energy fluxes. This is followed by the development of a new urban surface scheme for the ORCHIDEE model, incorporating urban heterogeneities and representation of imperviousness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThibault Lemaitre-Basset (2023)\nImportance de la demande en eau atmosphérique et anthropique en contexte de changement climatique sur la durabilité de la gestion de la ressource : cas d’étude du bassin versant de la Moselle en France\nSorbonne Université - Direction : Ludovic Oudin (METIS) & Guillaume Thirel (INRAE- UR HYCAR)\nFinancement ED GRNE\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThe climate projections analysed in the IPCC reports indicate an increase in air temperature ranging from +2 to +6 °C on average by 2100. A warming of this magnitude and speed is unprecedented, and it is due to human activities. Despite this fact, a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions does not seem to be in sight within a reasonable time frame. It is therefore necessary to think about adaptation strategies to mitigate the deleterious impacts of climate change. The water cycle is directly impacted by climate change, through an increase in atmospheric water demand that could lead to an increase in evapotranspiration, and through an increase in anthropogenic pressure on water resources, whose reserves may change. By relying on hydrological simulations under climate change scenarios, stakeholders can assess the magnitude of future changes. However, hydrological models often rely on stationarity assumptions that may not be valid under global change. The overall objective of this thesis is to introduce methodologies that implement hydrological modelling frameworks more suited to deal with the challenges faced by stakeholders in sustainable water resource management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniela Peredo (2021)\nQuels gains d’une modélisation hydrologique adaptée et d’une approche d’ensemble pour la prévision des crues rapides ?\nSorbonne Université - Direction : Ludovic Oudin (METIS) & Maria-Helena Ramos (INRAE- UR HYCAR)\nFinancement ED GRNE\n\n\nAbstract\n\nFlood forecasting plays a fundamental role in anticipating and implementing measures to protect lives and property. The objective of this thesis is to investigate our ability to improve the simulation and forecasting of major flash flood events in France. First, we analyse the limitations of the lumped hydrological modelling approach, and how the contribution of the semi-distributed hydrological model GRSD, with fine mesh and hourly time step, to improve the simulation of major flood events. We also propose a modification of the structure of the model, in order to make it better suited to reproducing the response of the catchments to high rainfall intensities. An adaptation of the model structure, based on the calculation of the production rate function, resulted in the introduction of a new parameter and the proposal of a new model (GRSDi) capable of better simulating the hydrological response to heavy rains that occur in autumn, after a dry summer period. Second, we explore the ability of a meteorological ensemble prediction approach, combined with the semi-distributed hydrological model, to better predict flash flood events, the amplitude and the time of occurrence of peak flows, whether in gauged or ungauged basins. The results made it possible to identify, from a hydrological point of view, the strengths and weaknesses of the products evaluated. The work carried out constitutes a step forward towards the use of conceptual, continuous and semi-distributed hydrological models for the forecasting of major flood events and flash floods in the Mediterranean context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMohamed Saadi (2020)\nReprésentation de l’urbanisation dans la modélisation hydrologique à l’échelle du bassin versant\nSorbonne Université - Direction : Ludovic Oudin (METIS) & Pierre Ribstein (METIS)\nFinancement ED GRNE\n\n\nAbstract\n\nIn order to determine the hydrological impact of future urban development, hydrological modeling is very useful because it allows obtaining hydrological scenarios from urbanization scenarios by considering climate variability. Despite the current diversity of applicable hydrological models to urbanized catchments, those models were generally tested on few catchments, which raises the question of their robustness. The objective of this thesis is to look for a hydrological model structure that is able to reproduce the rainfall-runoff relationship for a large sample of urbanized catchments, located in France and the United States, and characterized by a wide variety of urban sprawl. To do so, we started from an hourly conceptual model structure (GR4H) which was not specifically developed nor tested on highly urbanized catchments. We followed four steps: (1) The collection and preparation of a large sample of data for more than 2000 catchments located in France and the United States. The analysis of the variability of event runoff ratio for 852 US catchments showed the dependence of catchment response not only on mean total impervious area (TIA), but also on antecedent soil moisture conditions regardless of the level of urban sprawl in the catchment; (2) The test of the starting model structure on highly urbanized catchments. This step showed the ability of GR4H parameters to reflect the behavioral specificities of urbanized catchments; (3) The regionalization of GR4H parameters in order to relate them to the fraction of urban cover in the catchment. The obtained regression relationships performed well but showed weak sensitivity to change in the fraction of urban cover, which impeded their use for scenario prediction; (4) The step-by-step modification of the GR4H model structure by including excess rainfall on impervious surfaces, and by varying the partitioning between quick flow and slow flow depending on each catchment. The evaluation of these modifications on 273 urbanized catchments indicated an improvement in reproducing the observed flows in comparison to the original structure, especially during dry and flooding periods. The added parameters showed a strong dependence on the mean total impervious area. This thesis work illustrates a constructive modeling approach by which we have succeeded in both (1) improving the representation of urbanization within the model and (2) obtaining better simulation of catchment response. An effort of regionalizing the new model structure using measures of urban landscape fragmentation will allow to better estimate the impact of different urban planning schemes on the hydrological behavior at the catchment scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlorine Garcia (2016)\nAmélioration d’une modélisation hydrologique régionalisée pour estimer les statistiques d’étiage\nSorbonne Université - Direction : Ludovic Oudin (METIS) & Nathalie Folton (INRAE - UR RECOVER)\nFinancement bourse INRAE\n\n\nAbstract\n\nEstimating low-flow indices is of paramount importance to understand low flows and to manage water resources and risk assessments. These indices are derived from time-series of river discharges that are measured at gauged sites over long periods. At ungauged sites, the indices must be estimated. This research work is part of a project to improve “LoiEau”, a software package that is used by French regional environmental or water agencies. The main objective is to develop a simple and flexible rainfall-runoff model to simulate low-flow indices of ungauged sites at daily or longer time intervals. The model simplicity relies on the strong assumption that two free parameters are sufficient to provide accurate enough estimates of low-flow indices, yet making easier the regionalisation of models. The model accuracy depends on the objective function that is used to calibrate model parameters on gauged sites and had to be adapted to low-flow simulations. The model is flexible in the sense that it is designed to fit to a wide variety of catchments and hydro-meteorological behaviours. This model was compared with GR4J, a daily rainfall-runoff model which involves four parameters, and LoiEau, a monthly model. Comparisons were also carried out with a stochastic estimation method applied to a specific low-flow index. This research work shows the potential of the two-parameter model, but also the advantage of a daily time step to account for the temporal variability of precipitations, which is not without consequence on the assessment of average discharges due to the nonlinearity of rainfall-runoff models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarine Poncelet (2016)\nDu bassin au paramètre : jusqu’où peut-on régionaliser un modèle hydrologique conceptuel ?\nFinancement Kic-Climat\n\n\nAbstract\n\nWater resources are variable in time and space. Hydrological models are required to assess these resources and have to cope with catchments complexity and measurement limits. Most of the catchments are gauged which means that streamflow measurements are available at the catchment outlet. In particular, streamflow measurements can be used to analyse the catchment hydrological behavior and calibrate model parameters. However for ungauged catchments, the hydrological behavior must be define by other ways and model parametrisation must be assessed through regionalization instead of calibration.Regionalization studies rely on gauged catchments to developp methodologies applicable to ungauged catchments. They cover a large range of applications from hydrological signatures predictions (mean streamflow, regime, flow duration curves …) to low-flow or flood predictions. The present work aims at estimating streamflow hydrographs in ungauged catchments by regionalizing hydrological model parameters.Several methods have been developped to solve this problem and they mostly rely on the knowledge of parameter sets on gauged catchments to find the best way to transfer the parameters sets between catchments. Gauged catchments are then considered as donor catchments while ungauged catchments are receiver: the challenge of transfert-based methods being to assign the correct donnor to each receiver. However, these methods make two strong hypothesis: (i) parameters sets calibrated on gauged catchments are reliable and (ii) similar gauged and ungauged catchments can be accurately matched during the transfer. However, those hypothesis do not always seem to hold true. In this context, regional calibration appears as a promising way for hydrological model regionalization since regional calibration look for common parameter sets on several catchments. This way, parameters are known with less uncertainties on gauged catchment and parameters regionalization is joined with calibration. The challenge of this PhD thesis is to develop and apply a regionalization scheme, based on regional calibration, to the GR6J hydrological model. On a large dataset, we have studied if regional calibration is a competitive solution to regionalize hydrological models compared to existing methodologies (i.e. transfer-based methods).As a prelude to the regionalization study, we paid attention to analyse the model on gauged catchments. In particular, we analysed the model sensitivity to its parameters to define the functionnal role of each parameter. Eight model parametrisation schemes were tested to identify the hydrologically optimal parameter set, i.e. a parameter set that is only catchment-dependant and do not depend on calibration strategy. Secondly we present an inovative method called “group calibration”, based on regional calibration, to link model parameters and hydrological descriptors. This method is fit for taking into account compensations between model parameters, allows the hydrological interpretation of the obtained relationships and is competitive to existing methods. Last, we conceptualize the regionalization methods to better undestand how to best value regional informations and increase model performance in extrapolation. We show that all methods set a ceilling and that space for improvement do not lie in the correct matching of donnor and reciever catchments but in the identification of more easily transferable informations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBahar Salavati (2015)\nImpact de l’urbanisation sur la réponse hydrologique des bassins versants urbains\nSorbonne Université - Direction : Ludovic Oudin (METIS) & Pierre Ribstein (METIS)\nFinancement Campus France - CNOUS\n\n\nAbstract\n\nWater resources are variable in time and space.
